### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have over six years of experience in designing and developing dynamic websites with interactive features that drive business growth and improve user experience. I use React.js with Next.js in frontend development, creating static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) pages, and refactoring projects from Angular.js to React.js. I also use Redux for state management, Cypress for end-to-end, integration, and component testing, and Tailwind.css and Material-UI for building custom themes.

I am passionate about web performance and SEO optimization, and I use Webpack, Gulp, Babel, and Eslint to implement best practices and solutions. I also work with API-centric design approach, use CSS3 and HTML5 for designing websites, and use JavaScript ES6+ features to develop the entire website. I have experience in checking pull requests, implementing Scrum strategies, and collaborating with other frontend teams. I have multiple certifications in Python programming, CCNA routing and switching, and coping with difficult people. I am a versatile, innovative, creative, and proven team player who strives to deliver high-quality products and services.
